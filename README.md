# Project 1 - Grammy Analysis
In this project we will look at data on Grammy nominees and winners for Record of the Year and Album of the Year from 2010-2019 to see if we can determine a trend in winners or if they are "rigged".

We used data such as song features, winners by genre, whether the winning artist performed at the same year's Grammy show, and how many nominations and wins artists received.

Visualizations include pie charts showing winner breakdowns by genre, a bar chart, dot plots, and a correlation matrix showing song feature relations between nominated songs.
